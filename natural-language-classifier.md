# Natural Language Classifier

IBM Watson™ Natural Language Classifier uses machine learning algorithms to return the top matching predefined classes for short text inputs.

Natural Language Classifier can help your application understand the language of short texts and make predictions about how to handle them. A classifier learns from your example data and then can return information for texts that it is not trained on.

### How you use the service
