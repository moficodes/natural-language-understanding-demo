# What Does the Text Say

We are producing more data every day than we know what to do with. Most of these data is raw text which is impossible for human to parse in time and improbable for computers to make sense of. But with AI and ML we can start creating models that allows us to start making sense of this data.

## How Much Data Do We Produce

To say we generate a lot of data is an understatement. In the last couple of years we produced 90% of the worlds data.

Most of the data that are being generated our raw data \(untagged photo, random video and text - so much text\).

* 500 million tweets are sent
* 294 billion emails are sent
* 4 petabytes of data are created on Facebook
* 4 terabytes of data are created from each connected car
* 65 billion messages are sent on WhatsApp
* 5 billion searches are made

## Why Do We Care?

Most of this data is coming from social media. But there is a huge part of data that was seemingly for human interaction. Imagine from the point of view of a business, you get customer reviews and emails. Being able to properly label such reviews and emails are crucial for your operation. If you are a content creator being able to judge what people are saying about your product is something you care about.

Being able to analyze and understand the context of text is crucial in so many ways. If we could write things in maps and well-defined schemas we could have automated a lot more things than we have already. But humans don't interacted in formatted strings. So computers has to get smarter to understand unstructured data.
