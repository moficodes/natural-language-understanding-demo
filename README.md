# Natural Language Understanding

We are producing more data every day than we know what to do with. Most of these data is raw text which is impossible for human to parse in time and improbable for computers to make sense of. But with AI and ML we can start creating models that allows us to start making sense of this data.

### What is NLU

**Natural-language understanding** \(**NLU**\) or **natural-language interpretation** \(**NLI**\) is a subtopic of [natural-language processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural-language_processing) in [artificial intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence) that deals with machine [reading comprehension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reading_comprehension). Natural-language understanding is considered an [AI-hard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI-hard) problem.
