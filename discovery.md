# Discovery

IBM Watson™ Discovery makes it possible to rapidly build cognitive, cloud-based exploration applications that unlock actionable insights hidden in unstructured data — including your own proprietary data, as well as public and third-party data.

This is the architecture of a complete Discovery solution:

With Discovery, it only takes a few steps to prepare your unstructured data, create a query that will pinpoint the information you need, and then integrate those insights into your new application or existing solution.

How does Discovery do it? By using data analysis combined with cognitive intuition to take your unstructured data and enrich it so you can discover the information you need.

IBM Watson™ Discovery brings together a functionally rich set of integrated, automated Watson APIs to:

* Crawl, convert, enrich and normalize data.
* Securely explore your proprietary content as well as free and licensed public content.
* Apply additional enrichments such as concepts, relations, and sentiment through Natural Language Understanding \(NLU\).
* Simplify development while still providing direct access to APIs.

You can also use Smart Document Understanding \(SDU\) to train IBM Watson™ Discovery to extract custom fields in your documents. See [Smart Document Understanding](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/discovery?topic=discovery-sdu#sdu) for more information.

IBM Watson™ Discovery Knowledge Graph is a beta feature which provides new end-points for querying entities and relations across documents. This includes context-based searches and relevance ranking. See [IBM Watson™ Discovery Knowledge Graph](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/discovery?topic=discovery-kg#kg) for more information.

US Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act \(HIPAA\) support is available for Premium plans in the Washington, DC location created on or after 1 April 2019. See [Enabling EU and HIPAA supported settings](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-eu-hipaa-supported#eu-hipaa-supported) for more information.
